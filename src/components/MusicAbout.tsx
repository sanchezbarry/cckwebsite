To be a community of God’s children, enjoying a deep and satisfying relationship with Him, and continually sanctified to delight in His presence. Our Worship Ministry includes singers, musicians, media crew and sound crew. Just as “each joint giveth supply”, we see ourselves as part of the church body helping to provide a conducive environment for our congregation to enter into the presence of the Lord in praise, worship and the Word.
